The famine is severe enough that it has had major effects on human society, including the abandonment of any scientific pursuit that is not directly related to solving the world's food problem. Government-run schools actively discourage students from studying subjects such as space exploration, claiming that historical events like the moon landing were a political hoax and that scientific organizations such as NASA were shut down due to a belief that it was a waste of money and resources.   Cooper ignores his daughter, Murph, when she claims a ghost is communicating to her through her bookshelf, but later finds dust particles forming an inexplicable pattern on Murph's bedroom floor. He studies the pattern and discovers a coded message leading him to a secret government facility where Professor Brand explains that NASA was not shut down, but rather has been secretly tasked by the government to explore the possibility of finding humanity a new home away from Earth. Blight, dust storms, and failing crops have rendered humans incapable of surviving. Brand claims to be working on a gravity equation to make this mission possible, and asks Cooper to pilot an exploratory spacecraft. Cooper agrees, promising a distraught Murph that he will return. He pilots a shuttle carrying scientists Romilly, Doyle, and Brand’s daughter Amelia to dock with the spacecraft Endurance. The ship is headed towards a wormhole that mysteriously appeared near Saturn decades ago.  The Endurance passes through the wormhole into another galaxy with a planetary system orbiting a supermassive black hole called Gargantua. The crew intends to investigate three planets, each previously explored by NASA volunteers, who shared positive reports for habitability. The first planet is an aqua planet with massive tidal waves and no dry land. Due to an error made by Amelia, Doyle drowns after failing to get into the probe and getting knocked off by one of the waves. The same mistake also caused the engines to be filled with water forcing them to wait significantly longer than required for the engines to dry out. Amelia and Cooper fly back to the Endurance, only to find that decades have passed due to the time dilation caused by the planet's proximity to Gargantua. Romilly, having remained onboard, has aged 23 years. Cooper replays messages from Earth, learning that Murph is now his age and has become a scientist working with Brand.  The crew journeys to the second planet to find the previous NASA explorer, Mann, who is still alive and has established a base. On Earth, Murph learns from a dying Professor Brand that he gave up on solving his gravity equation years ago because it would take data from inside a black hole to reconcile, which is impossible to achieve. He reveals that he never intended for their mission to evacuate humanity from Earth to succeed, and was instead planning for Cooper and his fellow astronauts to try to establish their colony and hopefully restart the human race using thousands of pre-fertilized eggs. He dies, and a distraught Murph relays this information to the crew. As they explore the second planet, they discover that Mann falsified the data in his reports so that the NASA mission would come to rescue him. Romilly is killed by Mann's booby trap when he tries to access the logs, and Mann attempts to hijack the Endurance, but fails to dock properly, blowing out the hatch and killing himself in the process. Cooper and Amelia catch up with the damaged Endurance and dock safely.  With limited resources available to use their engines, Cooper proposes a slingshot move around Gargantua, using its gravity to propel them toward the final planet. To shed mass, Cooper sacrifices himself at the last minute, dropping into the black hole and leaving Amelia to complete the journey. Falling past the event horizon, Cooper finds himself inside a five-dimensional tesseract. He deduces that it was placed there by future humans with access to higher dimensions, as was the wormhole. He realizes that by using gravity, he can send messages to Murph and his past self. On Earth, Murph visits her childhood house after Professor Brand's death. She finds her father's old watch on her bookshelf and notices the second hand moving irregularly. She initially believes her \"ghost\" is back, only to realize that it was Cooper all along, sending her messages from a higher dimension. Cooper feeds Murph scientific data in morse code through the second hand about the black hole's singularity, which she eventually uses to solve the gravity equation, helping humanity escape Earth.  His mission is now complete, and Cooper is ejected by future beings from the tesseract. He is sent back through the wormhole and picked up by a ranger orbiting Saturn. Due to the time dilation around Gargantua, almost 90 years have passed in Earth time since Cooper left, though he has barely aged. He awakens on a cylindrical space station and reunites with Murph, now a celebrated scientist who helped humans survive extinction. Nearing death, she advises Cooper not to wait around to see her die and urges him to find Amelia, who may have settled on the other planet that could become their new home. Cooper steals a spacecraft and sets off on his new journey. On the other planet, Amelia is building a new colony for future humans to inhabit. She removes her helmet and breathes the air, showing that the planet is capable of supporting life."}, {"uuid": "ed801314f30011edb451b8aeed79c0cc", "title": "War of the Worlds", "year": 2005, "image": "War of the Worlds 2005 poster.jpg", "actors": ["Tom Cruise", "Dakota Fanning", "Miranda Otto", "Tim Robbins"], "plot": "  An opening narration by Morgan Freeman explains that Earth was being observed by extraterrestrials with immense intelligence and no compassion. As man dominated the world, without a doubt, much in the way microorganisms swarm in a drop of water, these beings plotted to take it all from them.  Divorced longshoreman Ray Ferrier works as a crane operator at a dock in Brooklyn, New York, and is estranged from his children: 10-year-old daughter Rachel, and teenage son Robbie. Ray's pregnant former wife, Mary Ann, drops the two off at his house in Bayonne, New Jersey, on her way to visit her parents in Boston. Later, a strange storm occurs during which lightning strikes multiple times into the middle of a nearby intersection, causing an EMP that instantly fries almost all electronic devices. Ray reluctantly joins the crowd at the scene of the impacts, where a massive \"tripod\" war machine emerges from the ground and uses powerful energy weapons to destroy the area, disintegrating most of the witnesses into gray ash.  Ray collects his children, steals the only working van, and drives to Mary Ann's empty home in suburban New Jersey to take refuge. That night, they take shelter in the basement, but they soon hear a strange roaring noise followed by an explosion, which destroys the house. The next morning Ray and Robbie discover that a Boeing 747 had crashed into the neighborhood. Ray meets a wandering news team scavenging the wreckage for food, who explains to him that multiple tripods have attacked major cities around the world, adding that the tripods have force shields to protect them from most of humanity's defenses, and the tripods' pilots traveled to Earth within the lightning storms as a way to enter their machines, which are assumed to have been buried underground for thousands of years.  Ray decides to drive the kids to Boston to be with their mother, but a desperate mob swarms around their vehicle, forcing them to abandon it. They eventually get to a Hudson River ferry, only to be surrounded by tripods, which either massacre or abduct many of the refugees, but Ray's family manages to escape. They witness US Marines engaging in a battle with some tripods. Much to Ray's dismay, Robbie joins the futile fight against the aliens out of hatred for the invaders, while Ray and Rachel quickly flee the scene. The Marines are obliterated, with Robbie presumed to have been killed with them. Shortly afterward, the pair are offered shelter in a nearby house by a deranged former ambulance driver named Harlan Ogilvy.  The three remain undetected for several days, even as a high-tech inspection camera and a group of aliens explore the basement. They soon discover that the aliens have started cultivating a red-colored vegetation across the landscape that is quickly spreading, and the group deduces that the aliens are terraforming Earth, and potentially using the red vegetation as a food source. One morning, Harlan suffers a mental breakdown after witnessing the tripods harvesting human blood and tissue to fertilize the alien vegetation. Fearing his mad shouting will alert the aliens, Ray reluctantly kills him. A second tripod camera then catches the Ferriers sleeping, causing Rachel to flee and get abducted by the tripod. Ray then intentionally attracts the aliens' attention to be pulled into the tripod and rescue Rachel; with help from other abductees, Ray destroys the tripod from within with grenades.  A few days later, Ray and Rachel arrive in Boston, where they find the alien vegetation withering and the tripods inexplicably collapsing. When an active tripod appears, Ray notices birds landing on it, indicating that its force shields have been disabled. Ray alerts the soldiers escorting the fleeing crowd, who shoot it down using anti-tank missiles. As the soldiers advance on the downed tripod, a hatch opens and a pale, sickly alien struggles halfway out before collapsing and dying. Ray and Rachel finally reach Mary Ann's parents' house, where they are reunited with Mary Ann and Robbie, who had somehow survived.  In closing, the narrator, echoing Wells' monologue from the original novel, explains that the aliens' deaths were due to their immune systems being unable to handle the countless microbes that inhabit the Earth, which \"God in His wisdom\" placed upon the planet to protect humans naturally co-existing with the rest of Earth's biosphere."}, {"uuid": "cd596964f30011edb451b8aeed79c0cc", "title": "Contact", "year": 1997, "image": "Contact ver2.jpg", "actors": ["Jodie Foster", "Matthew McConaughey", "James Woods", "John Hurt", "Tom Skerritt", "Angela Bassett"], "plot": "Dr. Ellie Arroway works for the SETI program at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. Guided into science and communication—starting with amateur radio—by her late father, she listens to radio emissions from space, hoping to detect evidence of intelligent alien life. David Drumlin, the president's science advisor, pulls the funding from SETI, believing the endeavor is futile. Arroway gains financial backing from Hadden Industries, run by secretive billionaire industrialist S. R. Hadden, which allows her to continue the project at the Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico.  Four years later, with Drumlin about to end the SETI program at the VLA, Arroway discovers a signal repeating a sequence of prime numbers, apparently sent from the star system Vega about 26 light-years away. This announcement causes Drumlin and the National Security Council led by Michael Kitz to attempt to take control of the facility. Arroway's team discovers a video hidden in the signal – Adolf Hitler's opening address at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany. Arroway and her team postulate that this would have been the first signal strong enough to leave Earth's ionosphere, reach Vega, and be transmitted back.  The project is put under tight security, and its progress is followed worldwide. Arroway finds that the signal also contains more than 63,000 pages of data. The reclusive S. R. Hadden secretly meets with Arroway to provide the means to decode the pages. The pages reveal schematics for a complex machine that is determined to be some kind of transport for a single occupant.  Multiple nations fund the construction of the machine at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral. An international panel is assembled to choose a candidate to travel in the machine. Arroway is a frontrunner to go until Christian philosopher Palmer Joss, a panel member whom Arroway met and briefly became romantically involved with in Puerto Rico, brings attention to her atheism; the panel selects Drumlin as more representative of humanity. When the machine is first tested, a religious terrorist destroys the machine in a suicide bombing, killing Drumlin and several others.  Hadden, now in residence on the Mir space station and dying of cancer, reveals to Arroway that the U.S. government had contracted with his company to secretly build a second machine in Japan, and that as the only American remaining among the candidate pool, Arroway will be the one to go. Outfitted with several recording devices, Arroway enters the machine's pod, which is then dropped into three rapidly spinning gimbaled rings, causing the pod to apparently travel through a series of wormholes. Arroway sees a radio array-like structure at Vega and signs of an advanced civilization on another planet. She then finds herself on a beach, similar to a childhood picture she drew of Pensacola, Florida. A figure approaches that becomes her deceased father. Arroway recognizes him as an alien taking her father's form and attempts to ask questions. The alien tells her that the familiar landscape and form were used to make their first contact easier for her and that this journey was just humanity's first step to joining other spacefaring species.  Arroway falls unconscious as she begins traveling back through a wormhole. She awakens to find herself on the floor of the pod, the mission control team repeatedly hailing her. She learns that, from outside the machine, it appears that the pod merely dropped through the machine's rings and landed in a safety net. Arroway insists that she was gone for approximately 18 hours, but her recording devices show only noise. A Congressional Committee is formed and speculates that the signal and machine were a hoax designed by the now-deceased Hadden. Arroway asks the committee to accept the truth of her testimony on faith. In a private online conversation, Kitz and White House official Rachel Constantine reflect on confidential information that, although Arroway's recording device only recorded static, it recorded 18 hours of it. Arroway and Joss reunite, and Arroway receives ongoing financial support at the VLA."}, {"uuid": "4219c5a6f30a11edb451b8aeed79c0cc", "title": "The Avengers", "year": 2012, "image": "The Avengers (2012 film) poster.jpg", "actors": ["Robert Downey Jr.", "Chris Evans (actor)", "Chris Evans", "Mark Ruffalo", "Chris Hemsworth", "Scarlett Johansson", "Jeremy Renner", "Tom Hiddleston", "Stellan Skarsgård", "Samuel L. Jackson"], "plot": "The Asgardian Loki encounters the Other, the leader of an extraterrestrial race known as the Chitauri. In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract, a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises Loki an army with which he can subjugate Earth. Nick Fury, director of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., arrives at a remote research facility, where physicist Dr. Erik Selvig is leading a team experimenting on the Tesseract. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a wormhole, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki steals the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and other agents, including Clint Barton, to aid him.  In response, Fury reactivates the \"Avengers Initiative\". Agent Natasha Romanoff heads to Kolkata to recruit Dr. Bruce Banner to trace the Tesseract through its gamma radiation emissions. Fury approaches Steve Rogers to retrieve the Tesseract, and Agent Phil Coulson visits Tony Stark to have him check Selvig's research. Loki is in Stuttgart, where Barton steals the iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power, leading to a confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki gets escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., his adoptive brother Thor arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. Stark and Rogers intervene and Loki is taken to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the Helicarrier, where he is imprisoned.  The Avengers become divided over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop powerful weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As they argue, Loki's agents attack the Helicarrier, and the stress causes Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers work to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff knocks Barton unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Loki uses the Tesseract and a wormhole generator Selvig built to open a wormhole above Stark Tower to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.  Rogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, Thor, and the Hulk rally in defense of New York City, and together the Avengers battle the Chitauri. The Hulk beats Loki into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the generator, where Selvig, freed from Loki's mind control, reveals that Loki's scepter can shut down the generator. Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at Midtown Manhattan. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit loses power, and he goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves him. In the aftermath, Thor returns with Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, where Loki will face their justice.  In a mid-credits scene, the Other confers with his master about the failed attack on Earth. "}]
